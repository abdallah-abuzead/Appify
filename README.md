# Appify Project


## ✨ Description
Appify project created in Flutter using Cubit and Bloc. Appify supports both Android and iOS platforms.
It introduces services for cars, like internal wash, external wash, chemical wash, and so on.
It lists all the nearest workshops to your current location.

## Getting Started

Appify contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants, and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boilerplate code as a standard initializer, we can have the same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use the same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

2- app_injections - includes all injected instances used in the app. 
3- app_locale - Contains all app-supported locals, and switches between them. 
4- app_router — This file contains all the navigation methods for your application, and it uses Get routing.

Here is the module folder structure I have been using for this project.
Each module has the same structure and layers, so I'll explain one module and the other modules are the same.

```
modules/
|- auth/
|- home/
|- reservations/
    |- data/
        |- data_sources/
            |- reservations_remote_data_source.dart
        |- models/
            |- reservation.dart
        |- repositories/
            |- reservations_repository.dart
    |- domain/
        |- entities/
        |- repositories/
        |- use_cases/

            |- reservation_details_screen.dart
            |- reservations_screen.dart
        |- widgets/
            |- order_details_screen/
                |- order_details_item.dart
            |- reservations_screen/
                |- pending_tab.dart
                |- reservation_card.dart
                |- reservation_card_details_item.dart
|- settings/

```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application-level configurations are defined in this file i.e., theme, routes, title, orientation, etc.

```dart
import 'package:easy_localization/easy_localization.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'core/app/app_initializer.dart';
import 'core/app/my_app.dart';
import 'core/app_locale/app_locale.dart';
import 'core/constants/app_url.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await AppInitializer.initSettingsAndServices();
  runApp(
    EasyLocalization(
      supportedLocales: const [AppLocale.arabic, AppLocale.english],
      path: AppUrl.translations,
      startLocale: AppLocale.arabic,
      fallbackLocale: AppLocale.arabic,
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

```
