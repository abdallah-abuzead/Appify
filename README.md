# Appify Project

Appify project created in flutter using Cubit and Bloc. Appify supports both android and iOS platforms.

## Getting Started

The Appify contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- assets
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

```
assets/
|- fonts/
|- icons/
|- images/
|- languages/
|- lottie/
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- core/
|- modules/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

1- app - Contains all needed initializations of services and setting for the app. 
2- app_injections - includes all injected instances used in the app. 
3- app_locale - Contains all app supported locals, and switch between them. 
4- app_router — This file contains all the navigation methods for your application, and it uses Get routing.

10- widgets — Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
```

Here is the modules folder structure which flutter provides.
Each module has the same structure and layers, so I'll explain one module and the other modules are the same.

```
modules/
|- auth/
|- home/
|- reservations/
    |- data/
        |- data_sources/
            |- reservations_remote_data_source.dart
        |- models/
            |- reservation.dart
        |- repositories/
            |- reservations_repository.dart
    |- domain/
        |- entities/
        |- repositories/
        |- usecases/
    |- presentaion/
        |- cubits/
            |- reservations/
                |- reservations_cubit.dart
                |- reservations_state.dart
            |- reservations_actions/
                |- reservations_actions_cubit.dart
                |- reservations_actions_state.dart
        |- screens/
            |- order_details_screen.dart
            |- reservation_details_screen.dart
            |- reservations_screen.dart
        |- widgets/
            |- order_details_screen/
                |- order_details_item.dart
            |- reservations_screen/
                |- pending_tab.dart
                |- reservation_card.dart
                |- reservation_card_details_item.dart
|- settings/

```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```dart
import 'package:easy_localization/easy_localization.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'core/app/app_initializer.dart';
import 'core/app/my_app.dart';
import 'core/app_locale/app_locale.dart';
import 'core/constants/app_url.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await AppInitializer.initSettingsAndServices();
  runApp(
    EasyLocalization(
      supportedLocales: const [AppLocale.arabic, AppLocale.english],
      path: AppUrl.translations,
      startLocale: AppLocale.arabic,
      fallbackLocale: AppLocale.arabic,
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

```
